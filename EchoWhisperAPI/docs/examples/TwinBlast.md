# TwinBlast

## TwinBlast Intro

TwinBlast is a dual-wielding gunslinger, built to be self-reliant and evasive. Using his abilities, TwinBlast can create opportunities to output high amounts of burst damage. When playing TwinBlast, look for opportunities to quickly burst down targets. Rapid fire can give you the upper hand when engaging an enemy, taking a chunk of their health before the enemy knows what hit them. Rocket Dash will allow you to reposition during team fights, but consider saving it for the perfect moment. It can easily get you out of bad situations, or allow you to close the gap to finish off an enemy.
