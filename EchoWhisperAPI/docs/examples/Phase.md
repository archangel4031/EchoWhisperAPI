# Phase	

## Phase Intro

Phase is a powerful telepath, who manipulates energy waves to protect her allies. A well known music aficionado, Phase scoured Omeda for talent and discovered Shinbi, guiding the singer in a rise to fame. Phase is all about getting allies out of bad situations, and turning the tide of battle. In teamfights, you can easily move your link to whoever needs it the most. Attaching your link to an ally with hard engage could create opportunities for you to blind and disorient several enemies. Know your limits when playing Phase. If you try to dive too deep to save an ally, it could result in your death.

While Linked, if Phase activates an ability, both she and her Linked Ally will receive 16/40 Health per second for 4 seconds.

-   **Hyperflux**: Phase overcharges herself and her Linked Ally with energy, giving both 70/100 Attack Speed, 50 Reduction and 15/45 Mana Regen for 8/16s. Upon activating the ability, they will also both receive a decaying 30% Movement Speed boost.
